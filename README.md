This project is a part of "The Odin Project" curriculum and tries to challenge students, like myself, to create a website with only a finished design reference image.
I try to come as close as possible to the design by writing my own HTML and CSS code: https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/81a5d553f4073e593d23a6ab00d50eef8620796d/foundations/html_css/project/imgs/01.png.
For future affairs this website could be used as a finished template (i.e. own portfolio, business, etc.). 
This learning sessions aims mainly on website compatibility with web browsers on desktop setups, not mobile devices.
